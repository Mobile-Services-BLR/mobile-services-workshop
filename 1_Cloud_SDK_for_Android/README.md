2) Download [SAP Cloud Platform SDK for android](https://developers.sap.com/trials-downloads.html?search=sap%20cloud%20platform%20sdk%20for%20android)

3) Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file to a folder on your computer.

4) Run the .\install.bat (Windows) ./install (Mac) which will copy the libraries to Users\user_name\.m2\repository and install a plugin into Android Studio. The script installs the Android Wizard plugin in Android Studio and copies the SDK libraries to your local Maven repository.
